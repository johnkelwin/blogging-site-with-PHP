                  <h2>why we use integration?</h2>
                  <p class="text">When I was studying in school,I asked my teachers and well studying students,"why we use integration?".Some of them said we use integration to find area and volume of the object we draw in graph.
                  </p>
                   <?php include "ads/article-ad-1.php" ?>
                  <h2>But the correct reason is:</h2>
                  <p class="text">That's not a wrong answer,yes we use integration to find area and volume in graph.But the actual reason hide here,lets see an example.If x has the value 1,2(x=1,2) if I ask you to sum the values of x you will just simply sum those values and say 1+2=3.If I replace the value of x with continuous  value like this  1&le;x&le;2, and ask you,what is the sum of values of x.Can you say the answer?you can't just say the answer by adding 1 and 2 because the values of x ranges from 1 to 2.you can't sum them with normal addition because between 1 and 2 we
                   have infinite values (1...,1.000001,....2).To sum this types of continuous values we use integration.you can't sum number from 1 to 10, inbetween we have numbers like 1.00000000001.So by using integration we can also add those numbers.For those addition only we use integration.</p>

                  <h2>Why we use integration to find volume and area in graph?</h2>
                  <p class="text">As I mentioned above,in graph also we use integration to sum continuous value.In graph we will draw a circle or some thing by plotting points and we will note the starting and ending points then we will use the formula which has the variable x (eg:x+2) then we will replace the value of x with value which ranges form starting to ending point of the graph that we note at the begining and add the formula(eg:x+2) for different values of x.Here the values of x is continuous.So to add continuous value we use integration to find area and volume in graphs</p>

                  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                  <p class="text">Finally we know that we use integration to sum continuous values(eg:1&le;x&le;2).In graph to find area and volume we use integration to sum continuous value which means we use integration to find area and volume in graph.</p>
